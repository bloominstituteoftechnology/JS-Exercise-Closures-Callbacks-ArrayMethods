 * ### Challenge `processFirstItem`
 * 
 * @instructions
 * Implement a higher-order function called `processFirstItem`.
 * It takes two arguments:
 * @param stringList an array of strings.
 * @param callback function that takes a string as its argument.
 * @returns the result of invoking `callback` with the FIRST element in `stringList`.
 * 
 * Example of usage of this higher-order function:
 * Invoking `processFirstItem` passing `['foo', 'bar']` and `(str) => str + str`,
 * should return 'foofoo'.

/* Task 1: `counterMaker`

 * 2. Which of the two uses a closure? How can you tell?
 * 
 * 3. In what scenario would the counter1 code be preferable? In what scenario would counter2 be better?

/* Task 2: inning() 

Write a function called `inning` that generates a random number of points that a team scored in an inning. This should be a whole number between 0 and 2. */

function inning(/*Code Here*/){

/* Task 3: finalScore()

Write a higher order function called `finalScore` that accepts the callback function `inning` (from above) and a number of innings and and returns the final score of the game in the form of an object.

For example, 

finalScore(inning, 9) might return: 
{
  "Home": 11,
  "Away": 5,
}

*/

/* Task 4: 

Create a function called `scoreboard` that accepts the following parameters: 

(1) Callback function `getInningScore`
(2) Callback function `inning`
(2) A number of innings

and returns the score at each pont in the game, like so:

1st inning: awayTeam - homeTeam
2nd inning: awayTeam - homeTeam
3rd inning: awayTeam - homeTeam
4th inning: awayTeam - homeTeam
5th inning: awayTeam - homeTeam
6th inning: awayTeam - homeTeam
7th inning: awayTeam - homeTeam
8th inning: awayTeam - homeTeam
9th inning: awayTeam - homeTeam

Final Score: awayTeam - homeTeam */
